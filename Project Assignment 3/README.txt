Our app is on Nick's tablet. The app currently works as a stand alone app on a smartphone but when we run the app on the tablet it crashes 
when you click on the education tab. We have tried many methods to fix this issue but have had no luck. The app works perfectly on a single
pane decive such as a smart phone which we used to demo during the presentation. The education tab works on a single pane device but since
the tablet is a 2 pane device it crashes at that point.
